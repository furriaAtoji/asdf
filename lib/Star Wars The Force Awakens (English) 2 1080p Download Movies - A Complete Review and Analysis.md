Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the most successful and popular films of all time. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised its action, humor, nostalgia, and new characters. It also broke several box office records, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2015 and the third-highest-grossing film ever. It was nominated for five Academy Awards and won four BAFTA Awards.
 
The film is set thirty years after the events of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), in which the Rebel Alliance defeated the Galactic Empire and restored democracy to the galaxy. However, a new threat has emerged: the First Order, a military dictatorship that seeks to revive the legacy of the Empire and destroy the New Republic. The First Order is led by Supreme Leader Snoke, a mysterious and powerful dark side user, and his apprentice Kylo Ren, a former Jedi who turned to the dark side and killed his fellow students. The First Order is also in pursuit of Luke Skywalker, the last surviving Jedi Master, who went into hiding after Kylo Ren's betrayal.
 
Meanwhile, on the desert planet of Jakku, a young scavenger named Rey lives a lonely and hard life, salvaging parts from wrecked starships and selling them for food. She encounters a droid named BB-8, who carries a map to Luke Skywalker's location. She also meets Finn, a former stormtrooper who defected from the First Order after witnessing their atrocities. Together, they escape from Jakku with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, who are also looking for Luke. Along the way, they encounter Maz Kanata, an old friend of Han's who reveals that Rey is Force-sensitive and offers her Luke's old lightsaber. However, before Rey can accept it, she is captured by Kylo Ren, who senses her connection to the Force and wants to extract the map from her mind.
 
Finn, Han, Chewbacca, and BB-8 join forces with Poe Dameron, a Resistance pilot who was sent by General Leia Organa to retrieve BB-8 and the map. They launch an attack on Starkiller Base, a superweapon that can destroy entire star systems. They manage to rescue Rey and destroy the base's shield generator, but Han confronts Kylo Ren on a bridge and tries to persuade him to return to the light side. Kylo Ren kills Han in front of Rey and Finn, enraging them. Rey and Finn then face Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel in the snow-covered forest. Rey manages to overpower Kylo Ren and injures him severely, but they are separated by a fissure caused by the base's imminent collapse. Rey escapes with Finn, who is wounded but alive, on the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and BB-8.
 
Rey then travels to Ahch-To, a remote oceanic planet where Luke Skywalker is hiding. She finds him on a cliff overlooking the sea and offers him his lightsaber. Luke stares at her with a mix of surprise and curiosity as she waits for his response.
